    "body": "#Are online annual reports the right solution for your company? \r\n\r\nIn the last few years, more and more U.S. public companies have chosen to produce an online annual report—either as a standalone effort or in conjunction with a printed piece—to tell their story to investors and other key stakeholders. \r\n\r\nIn its purest sense, a Web-based online annual report is an HTML-coded Web presence, often self-contained in its own microsite. Technically speaking, interactive flipbooks and posted PDFs are considered part of the online annual report set, but for the purpose of this article, let’s leave them aside. \r\n\r\nWhen online annual reports initially appeared more than ten years ago, most were produced for the wow or coolness factor. But as the category has evolved, simply desiring to appear cutting-edge is probably not important enough in itself to validate the decision to produce your annual report online. \r\n\r\n##Making the right choice \r\n\r\nSo how should corporate investor relations professionals make the decision to produce \r\nan online annual report? Or put another way, how do they decide on the format, content and delivery mode for a corporation’s most critical and relevant conversation with key stakeholders - the annual report? \r\n\r\nFirst of all, there’s no magic bullet solution for every company. An individual company may even find that the right solution is different from one year to the next. Instead, IR officers need to weigh the pros and cons of different delivery options and choose the solution that’s right for their company. \r\n\r\n##Questions to consider \r\nTo help IR officers make the right decision, it’s often helpful to work through a series of questions like the ones below. By no means do these questions encompass every part of the consideration set, but they are a strong start. \r\n\r\n##Strategic considerations \r\n\r\n* What's your goal? Is there a story you need/want to tell? Is this merely a compliance document? \r\n* Who's your audience (or audiences)? What’s your shareholder base? Is the target going to be more receptive to an online report or a printed report? Do they want/expect both? \r\n* What's your budget? While it’s hard to say whether an online piece costs more or less than a printed piece—it depends on the features and ambition of each—there are two absolute truths: Online annual reports save on printing costs, and producing both an online and printed component costs more than just one or the other. \r\n* What industry is your company in? What are your competitors doing? How do you \r\ncompete and differentiate at the same time? \r\n\r\n* Is technology/innovation an important part of your business strategy? Is sustainability an important part of your business strategy? \r\n* How important is it that your Web site be viewed as an information site? \r\n\r\n##Theme and message \r\n* Is the telling of your story enhanced in a meaningful way by the ability to share it on the Web? Is the story better told in print? \r\n* Do you have a story to tell that can be highlighted or improved by the use of video or animation? \r\n\r\n##Format \r\n* How often do your executives refer to the printed annual report? Is it important for your CEO to have something in hand (hard copy) when talking with stakeholders? \r\n* Do you get many requests for the printed annual report? \r\n* Is the annual report an important marketing tool for your company? \r\n* Is social media an important part of how you disseminate investor communications? Should it be? \r\n* Is it important to share downloadable data files and XBRL via an online annual report or is that information readily available in another way? \r\n* Will it be important to be able to view your annual report on an iPad or PDA? \r\n* Is print on demand something that would work for your company? \r\n\r\n##Content \r\n* Do you have video or other interactive elements that can be re-purposed for the online annual report? \r\n* Conversely, can you amortize the cost of the report by re-purposing interactive elements developed for the online annual report in additional ways? \r\n* If you are considering video of your executives, are they telegenic and good on camera? Would showcasing these executives on camera build connection with investors or hurt it? \r\n* Will the use of interactive charts enhance your story or are they just unnecessary bells and whistles for your company? \r\n* Do you have additional information you would like to link to through the online report? \r\n* Are you proud of your corporate Web site? Do you want to drive more people to your site? \r\n\r\n##Conclusion \r\nAs you can see, many considerations must go into the decision to produce an online \r\nannual report. The decision is not easy, but it can be made easier with smart guidance from your investor relations counsel and annual report designer. \r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, the annual report is a company’s single best opportunity to share \r\nits story, vision and value drivers with key stakeholders. It serves multiple functions for multiple audiences, so it’s important to weigh the various options in order to provide the form of communication that best aligns your goals and objectives with your company’s culture and value proposition.
